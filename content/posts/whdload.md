## The best WHDload games IMHO

The [A500 mini](https://retrogames.biz/products/thea500-mini/) has finally arrived. I think enough ink has been spilled on the unit itself (as well as whatever you spill when you make YouTube videos) but suffice to say I have one, it's beautiful and easy to use, and it has some [cool games](https://retrogames.biz/games/thea500-mini/) on it. I've written [a post](({{< ref "a500mini.md" >}}))

### Getting started

I won't repeat what's in the [excellent manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SD6AsDUWG3B6X_AfmDxqihO-uNPJH6Y-/edit)- you should have no difficulty getting WHDload to work. One thing that's worth noting is it's just going to drop you into a file browser when you load up the mini Amiga so you can use folders to organise everything (e.g. have "A", "B", "C" folders, or "Shooter", "Strategy", "Puzzle" etc.)
