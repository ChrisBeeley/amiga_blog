## A500 mini- built in games roundup

The [A500 mini](https://retrogames.biz/products/thea500-mini) is here. Much has been written about it already so I'm not going to say too much about it, but I was halfway through a post about it when I realised it might be fun just to give my recommendations for the best games on the unit. In truth the games are quite disappointing and there are loads of classics which are missing. I think the problem comes down to getting rights to the games. When Nintendo made the mini SNES they put their best first party games on it and made a tidy packet from doing so. But my guess here is that a lot of games which are either licensed or might be expected to sell elsewhere are not on because the original IP holder wants to protect the revenue from selling the game elsewhere. This is quite understandable, of course. Anyway, there's another post where I talk about the brilliant games that are not on the unit and how to get them, but for now let's look at the [games that are on there](https://retrogames.biz/games/thea500-mini/).  

### Stone cold classic
