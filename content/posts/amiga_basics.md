In the [introduction of this blog]({{< ref "/posts/intro.md" >}}) there is a list of some of the different ways that you can get hold of an Amiga in modern times and this is the thing that by far confused me the most when I started back after 25 years away. There are a lot of different ways of getting your Amiga fix and this post is designed to help you to understand what the heck they are. Let's go back to the list from the introduction:

* Original hardware
* FS-UAE (emulation- Windows, Mac, Linux)
* Raspberry pi (several options here)
* A5000 (new hardware)
* Vampire (new FPGA powered hardware)
* MiSTer FPGA

This list breaks down essentially into the following types:

* Original hardware
* Emulation
* New hardware based on PowerPC
* FPGA

Don't worry if you don't know what half that stuff is, I'm going to tell you, as well as providing some links.
