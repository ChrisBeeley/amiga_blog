# C64 special

I bought a [mini C64](https://retrogames.biz/products/thec64-mini/) recently, I confess mainly because it comes with a joystick and I wanted one to play Sensi on my mini Amiga. Joysticks are not cheap and I think I picked up the C64 and the joystick for about £45 which means the C64 was effectively around £15. I have actually never in my life touched a real Commodore 64 and I have never played any games on one in any shape or form and so I thought it would be interesting to play them absolutely cold with no nostalgia. Sure, I love Alien Breed on the Amiga, but is that because I had fun playing it 30 years ago? This seemed like a good test. There is something like 64 games on there so I hardly think I'm going to play and write up all of them, so I'll go through alphabetically, play each one, and keep going with and write up the ones I find interesting.

To get me started, here is a complete list, which I will annotate as I go.
