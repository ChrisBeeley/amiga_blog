# Resources

I have been trying to catalogue things as I've found them but as I roam the internet looking for Amiga related stuff I'm finding so much stuff that I feel I need to start getting it all down in one place. I will continue to link stuff directly in posts where it's relevant, but I'm going to start compiling a mega list of links here. For now I'll just do a big list with subheadings but over time I might break it into several documents, see how it goes.

## Programming

[Online sprite editor](http://amigafonteditor.ozzyboshi.com/index_sprite.html) that outputs hex/ binary and a few other things ([and the code](https://github.com/Ozzyboshi/AmigaFontEditor))
