      <description>A500 mini- built in games roundup The A500 mini is here. Much has been written about it already so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say too much about it, but I was halfway through a post about it when I realised it might be fun just to give my recommendations for the best games on the unit. In truth the games are quite disappointing and there are loads of classics which are missing.</description>
      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a500-mini--built-in-games-roundup&#34;&gt;A500 mini- built in games roundup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogames.biz/products/thea500-mini&#34;&gt;A500 mini&lt;/a&gt; is here. Much has been written about it already so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to say too much about it, but I was halfway through a post about it when I realised it might be fun just to give my recommendations for the best games on the unit. In truth the games are quite disappointing and there are loads of classics which are missing. I think the problem comes down to getting rights to the games. When Nintendo made the mini SNES they put their best first party games on it and made a tidy packet from doing so. But my guess here is that a lot of games which are either licensed or might be expected to sell elsewhere are not on because the original IP holder wants to protect the revenue from selling the game elsewhere. This is quite understandable, of course. Anyway, there&amp;rsquo;s another post where I talk about the brilliant games that are not on the unit and how to get them, but for now let&amp;rsquo;s look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogames.biz/games/thea500-mini/&#34;&gt;games that are on there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stone-cold-classic&#34;&gt;Stone cold classic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alien Breed: Special Edition 92
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is basically Aliens: The Topdown shooter. Atmospheric, well paced, exciting, varied. Truly a masterpiece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinball Dreams
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is what the people who make Battlefield were doing in the 1990s, making pinball games. The tables are a little simplistic and small by modern standards and there&amp;rsquo;s only one standout table (Nightmare) but it&amp;rsquo;s still brilliant. The sequel, Pinball Fantasies, is better in every way and this can be added to the A500 mini, for more on which see a forthcoming post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A futuristic sport that basically involves hitting people and chucking a ball in a goal this will always raise a smile in multiplayer. It&amp;rsquo;s weaker for single players, as these things often are, but there is a career mode that is actually reasonably deep considering what a silly sport it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worms: The Director’s Cut
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worms. Brilliant on every format, ever. I never played the Amiga version back in the day so I&amp;rsquo;ve had a quick look for this post.  WHAT DO I THINK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Chaos Engine
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top down co-op shooter with beautiful graphics. A little primitive by today&amp;rsquo;s standards but still brilliant to this day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;worth-a-look&#34;&gt;Worth a look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATR: All Terrain Racing
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is kind of fun for two players. It&amp;rsquo;s a top down racer, basically. I am kind of a sucker for them so you may think it&amp;rsquo;s rubbish for all I know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;California Games
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very hard, like so many old school games, but silly and fun and very playable. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit confusing what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do, you may wish to have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=275&#34;&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYrSL3WQJf8&#34;&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; of some guides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paradroid 90
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually played this before, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty fun and the music is awesome (famously so, I believe). It&amp;rsquo;s not totally obvious exactly how you play, you may wish to consult &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=1194&#34;&gt;a guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another World
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is quite a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game)#Legacy&#34;&gt;seminal game&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a platform puzzley type thing, very evocative and beautiful. Not really my genre to be honest but it is great and it inspired such luminaries as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Kojima&#34;&gt;Hideo Kajima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arcade Pool
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is just a pool game, playing variants of US and UK pool. Not revolutionary but a solid, playable game with good physics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-bother&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t bother&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battle Chess
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chess with silly animations of the pieces. Seemed pretty cool all those years ago, now it seems silly. If you want to play chess though, it will do that, it&amp;rsquo;s just surely there&amp;rsquo;s a better way on your phone in this day and age?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zool: Ninja Of The ”Nth” Dimension
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amiga&amp;rsquo;s attempt at a Mario/ Sonic type mascot, this is a fast paced platformer. Surprisingly bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kick Off 2
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always controversial, some people loved it, some people hated it, some people loved to hate it. I used to enjoy playing this game with my brother back in the day but it&amp;rsquo;s unplayable garbage by today&amp;rsquo;s standards. Awful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The best WHDload games</title>
      <link>https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/whdload/</link>

      <description>The best WHDload games IMHO The A500 mini has finally arrived. I think enough ink has been spilled on the unit itself (as well as whatever you spill when you make YouTube videos) but suffice to say I have one, it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful and easy to use, and it has some cool games on it. My favourites are :
Getting started I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat what&amp;rsquo;s in the excellent manual- you should have no difficulty getting WHDload to work.</description>

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogames.biz/products/thea500-mini/&#34;&gt;A500 mini&lt;/a&gt; has finally arrived.

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat what&amp;rsquo;s in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SD6AsDUWG3B6X_AfmDxqihO-uNPJH6Y-/edit&#34;&gt;excellent manual&lt;/a&gt;- you should have no difficulty getting WHDload to work. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s worth noting is it&amp;rsquo;s just going to drop you into a file browser when you load up the mini Amiga so you can use folders to organise everything (e.g. have &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; folders, or &amp;ldquo;Shooter&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Strategy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Puzzle&amp;rdquo; etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>As I mentioned in my programming post I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with AMOS, because it&amp;rsquo;s AMOS that defeated me all those years ago with Space Invaders. There is stuff scattered about to help you learn and install AMOS but honestly it&amp;rsquo;s spread pretty thinly and there are quite a lot of broken links so I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a frustrating start. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write down What I Did for everyone&amp;rsquo;s benefit, including mine when I get stuck.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/programming/&#34;&gt;programming post&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m going to start with AMOS, because it&amp;rsquo;s AMOS that defeated me all those years ago with Space Invaders. There is stuff scattered about to help you learn and install AMOS but honestly it&amp;rsquo;s spread pretty thinly and there are quite a lot of broken links so I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a frustrating start. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write down What I Did for everyone&amp;rsquo;s benefit, including mine when I get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy AMOS/ Normal AMOS can be found in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/Commodore_Amiga_TOSEC_2012_04_10&#34;&gt;big archive of Amiga software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/amiga-game-makers-manual/mode/2up&#34;&gt;Amiga game maker&amp;rsquo;s manual with AMOS basic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/amigasourcecodepreservation/ultimate-amos/-/raw/master/pdf/ultimate-amos-1994-holborn.pdf&#34;&gt;Ultimate AMOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to give instructions that work on FS-UAE for Linux, which is what I&amp;rsquo;m using. I imagine it will be even simpler on a real Amiga. As for other types of Amigas, I really have no idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing so don&amp;rsquo;t listen to me. Speaking of not knowing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, I&amp;rsquo;m still sort of bobbing about trying to find the path of least resistance to learn this stuff, these are only notes really, hopefully in the future it will all make sense and I&amp;rsquo;ll write a follow up post that makes more sense. I will &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to put stuff on GitHub, but how the heck you get stuff from AMOS onto GitHub on an FS-UAE emulated instance of an Amiga I don&amp;rsquo;t at the moment have a clue. If I write something that works and figure it out, it will be here, trust me on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easy-amos&#34;&gt;Easy AMOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working through the manual of Easy AMOS. It&amp;rsquo;s very readable and accessible, but for someone who knows how to program (badly) it was a bit &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; basic. It&amp;rsquo;s all in there, I just wanted to move through the material a bit faster. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to program and you feel like learning a 29 year old programming language on an emulated version of hardware that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been manufactured in 26 years (not sure how many people there are in &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Venn diagram) go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;normal-amos&#34;&gt;Normal AMOS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;//TODO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amos-professional&#34;&gt;AMOS Professional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting AMOS Professional working is very easy. Go to the link above and download the zip file where indicated. Extract it, and you just want the folder called &amp;ldquo;AMOS&amp;rdquo;. Copy that folder somewhere you can keep it, then just drop it in as a hard drive in FS-UAE (go to the hard drive tab, select the little picture of a folder next to an empty hard drive slot, and then select the AMOS folder). You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a Workbench HD image too. That&amp;rsquo;s another blog post. I learned the above in these &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogamecoders.com/installing-amos-basic/&#34;&gt;excellent blog posts&lt;/a&gt; but the advice is in a video and I prefer to read stuff myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step is to work through the tutorials in the previous link which culminates in&amp;hellip; yes&amp;hellip; Space Invaders. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to count that as a &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; for this step though, I&amp;rsquo;ll make my own. Good start though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amiga basics</title>
      <link>https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/amiga_basics/</link>

      <description>In the introduction of this blog there is a list of some of the different ways that you can get hold of an Amiga in modern times and this is the thing that by far confused me the most when I started back after 25 years away. There are a lot of different ways of getting your Amiga fix and this post is designed to help you to understand what the heck they are.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/intro/&#34;&gt;introduction of this blog&lt;/a&gt; there is a list of some of the different ways that you can get hold of an Amiga in modern times and this is the thing that by far confused me the most when I started back after 25 years away. There are a lot of different ways of getting your Amiga fix and this post is designed to help you to understand what the heck they are. Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the list from the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FS-UAE (emulation- Windows, Mac, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry pi (several options here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A5000 (new hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vampire (new FPGA powered hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MiSTer FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A500 mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list breaks down essentially into the following types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A500 mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New hardware based on PowerPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what half that stuff is, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you, as well as providing some links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;original-hardware&#34;&gt;Original hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest, sort of. There&amp;rsquo;s a surprising amount of original Amiga hardware that is still alive and kicking. Very often things will be sold recapped, which means that the capacitors have been replaced. Often they will have had a good clean and test too. Recapping is pretty important because old capacitors can leak and damage the hardware. Other times you see listings that say &amp;ldquo;I just got this out of my loft, I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea if it works, you can buy it and find out if you want&amp;rdquo;. This is fine but clearly you are going to want to spend a lot less on such a purchase because you really don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies that sell old Amiga hardware. I feel sure I will buy an A1200 as soon as I find space for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ami64.com/amiga-computers&#34;&gt;Ami64.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.retropassion.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Retro Passion&lt;/a&gt;. The thing I love about this shop is that they will even sell you a replica box! There were some very fancy Amiga boxes back in the day but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had one, both my A500 and A1200 came in plain white boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are loads of upgrades you can get now for original hardware, such as CF based solid state hard drives, loads of accelerators, USB flash drives. Plugging an Amiga in to a modern TV can be a bit of a challenge, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand this well enough to help you but I gather it&amp;rsquo;s possible with the right adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emulation&#34;&gt;Emulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the simplest, sort of. There are two main types of emulation, really, normal PC and raspberry pi, so let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normal-pc&#34;&gt;Normal PC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Windows, I would just pick up a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amigaforever.com/&#34;&gt;Amiga Forever&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with emulation, Workbench, ROM files, everything you need really. It&amp;rsquo;s a little easier as far as I can tell, on Windows. For Linux and Mac you may end up buying Amiga Forever anyway, I did, because it comes as I mentioned with Workbench and ROM files. These files are not open source and so you can steal or buy them, basically. The cheapest way to get them is &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloanto.amigaforever.essentials&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US&#34;&gt;on Android&lt;/a&gt; but I use Linux and I bought Amiga Forever anyway because it comes with some free games and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of free games and stuff, there is absolutely masses of software &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/Commodore_Amiga_TOSEC_2012_04_10&#34;&gt;for download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Linux/ Windows/ Mac we have the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://fs-uae.net/&#34;&gt;FS UAE&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s an absolute doddle to get it working. If you want to play games I suggest you go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://openretro.org/&#34;&gt;open retro&lt;/a&gt;, create an account, and then add your favourite games to your favourites list. You can then &lt;a href=&#34;https://openretro.org/fs-uae-launcher&#34;&gt;import the list into FS UAE&lt;/a&gt; and they will appear in a list within the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing to say is that FS UAE supports &lt;a href=&#34;http://whdload.de/&#34;&gt;WHDLoad&lt;/a&gt; out of the box. WHDLoad is a way of bundling old Amiga games so they load from a hard drive even if the original didn&amp;rsquo;t support hard drives. Many games (like Turrican) even add multi button support. It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely wonderful and you need it in your life. DON&amp;rsquo;T do what I did and spend ages installing WHDLoad inside the actual OS (via Workbench). Although this will work, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this. Just get a WHDLoad file, stick it somewhere FS UAE can see it, click launch, and you&amp;rsquo;re off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a500-mini&#34;&gt;A500 mini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of WHDLoad, the forthcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogames.biz/thea500-mini&#34;&gt;A500 mini console&lt;/a&gt; supports WHDLoad too. It comes with 25 games, plugs in via HDMI, has an old style &amp;ldquo;tank&amp;rdquo; mouse&amp;quot;, and allows you to sideload your own WHDLoad games. It sounds wonderful. I have quite obviously pre-ordered one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Raspberry pi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few options here, if you just want to play games you can use something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://blitterstudio.com/amiberry/&#34;&gt;Amiberry&lt;/a&gt; which you can download in things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://retropie.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Retro Pie&lt;/a&gt; or is available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gunkrist79.wixsite.com/amibian&#34;&gt;Amibian&lt;/a&gt;. Another nice option is &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogamecoders.com/pimiga/&#34;&gt;PiMiga&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a souped up desktop, applications, and games straight out of the gate. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome. At the moment there is a 1.5 version, I gather 2.0 is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option for Raspberry pi is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amikit.amiga.sk/raspberry&#34;&gt;AmiKit&lt;/a&gt;, I fiddled around with the free Linux version and didn&amp;rsquo;t love it, but you might, have a look, don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it. There&amp;rsquo;s a free and a paid version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-hardware-based-on-powerpc&#34;&gt;New hardware based on PowerPC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the thing I know the least about, to be honest. There&amp;rsquo;s a type of computer called PowerPC, not just Amigas, it&amp;rsquo;s A Thing, and there was an AmigaOne X1000, and there is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amigaos.net/hardware/133/amigaone-x5000&#34;&gt;AmigaOne X5000 imminent&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s all I know. There doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a lot of stuff online. Sounds super interesting, just don&amp;rsquo;t really know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fpga&#34;&gt;FPGA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FPGA is what all the cool kids are doing now. It&amp;rsquo;s a system to emulate systems down to the chip level, like programmable silicon. The new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.analogue.co/pocket&#34;&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt; uses FPGA (it looks gorgeous, I may get one). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc&#34;&gt;MiSTer&lt;/a&gt; is what you want for an Amiga- it will emulate all kinds of things, including Amigas. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apollo-accelerators.com/&#34;&gt;Vampire project&lt;/a&gt; also uses FPGA technology and they make very, very fast Amigas which come in small cases and are reasonably priced. I really want one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-an-amiga&#34;&gt;What is an Amiga?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably can&amp;rsquo;t really leave this post without discussing what an Amiga actually is. Some people in the Amiga community get quite het up about this. Original hardware obviously is an Amiga. Emulation is pretending to be a real Amiga. But some of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about isn&amp;rsquo;t recognisably &amp;ldquo;Amiga&amp;rdquo; as such- more what the Amiga would have become, if you like. The likes of PiMiga, Vampire, AmigaOne X5000, they all have different operating systems and desktop environments. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand the technical bits well enough to give a good answer to what an Amiga is from a technical point of view. Amigas are special. They&amp;rsquo;re not like normal computers. There are people who love Amigas for whom only the original will do. And there are people who love Amigas who are trying to imagine the future of Amiga. To me, if you love Amiga, and you tell me something is an Amiga, that&amp;rsquo;s good enough for me. I&amp;rsquo;m really glad we have both types of enthusiast. I really think that the Amiga will never die, and that&amp;rsquo;s amazing, and that&amp;rsquo;s partly why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog, to help you understand how amazing it is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>If you read my introduction then you&amp;rsquo;ll know that part of the reason I&amp;rsquo;m doing this blog, doing any of this in fact, is because I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS 25 years ago, got a weird bug, and gave up. More for my reference than anything else (like 95% of my GitHub, in fact), here follows a list of the options I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at so far</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/intro/&#34;&gt;my introduction&lt;/a&gt; then you&amp;rsquo;ll know that part of the reason I&amp;rsquo;m doing this blog, doing any of this in fact, is because I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS 25 years ago, got a weird bug, and gave up. More for my reference than anything else (like 95% of my GitHub, in fact), here follows a list of the options I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at so far&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMOS (which comes in Easy and Professional form, as well as normal AMOS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlitzBasic (which got to version 2 but now seems to have been upgraded to the related 3, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amiblitz.de/index.php&#34;&gt;which looks pretty swish&lt;/a&gt; with an IDE and everything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C (I would love to learn C but I gather it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembler (I&amp;rsquo;ve read Assembler and it looks like what most people think normal programming languages look like- gobbledigook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much going to work down the list, I think, I&amp;rsquo;m going to go give BlitzBasic 3 a try, probably will bounce off that and then try C. But who knows? This is pretty fun, could end up anywhere. I highly doubt I will write a line of Amiga Assembler in my life but never say never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I should add is that I really want to write the code on an Amiga. An emulated one at the moment, and then perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll treat myself to a Vampire some time. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much room in the office but Vampires are pretty small. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write games &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the Amiga, I want to write them &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the Amiga. You know, for old time&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next post is I think one aimed at my buddies, entitled, &amp;ldquo;So you want to play Amiga games without buying any new hardware?&amp;rdquo; (super easy and cheap).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello! This blog is all about my return to the world of Amiga. I have been clicking occasionally on Amiga stuff that I saw in my Twitter feed and was amazed to see that an Amiga print magazine was being launched in the UK. I was an avid user of the Amiga from about 1988 until about 1995. It was a really important part of my life and the hours of messing around I used to do with Workbench to get everything working are probably partly the reason why I do the job that I do (data scientist, which I absolutely love).</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello! This blog is all about my return to the world of Amiga. I have been clicking occasionally on Amiga stuff that I saw in my Twitter feed and was amazed to see that an Amiga print magazine was being launched in the UK. I was an avid user of the Amiga from about 1988 until about 1995. It was a really important part of my life and the hours of messing around I used to do with Workbench to get everything working are probably partly the reason why I do the job that I do (data scientist, which I absolutely love). I might do a nostalgic trip through what growing up with Amiga (500, then 1200 with 60MB hard drive) was like but that isn&amp;rsquo;t for today, this is just kicking things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog for a few reasons. Firstly, because I cannot believe how strong the Amiga community is today. The Amiga lives on, 25 years later, and there are so many awesome helpful people in it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t met any of them or even written a message on a board but I can tell that they are my people. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve come home after a long absence. I want to be a part of that community and hopefully give something back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, because the Amiga scene, even though it is full of awesome people sharing their knowledge, is pretty confusing. Some people are using old hardware, and I would absolutely love to get some original hardware, but there are a lot of options now. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done all the research yet (but I will, for this blog) but broadly the options are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FS-UAE (emulation- Windows, Mac, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry pi (several options here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A5000 (new hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vampire (new FPGA powered hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MiSTer FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A500 mini&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new version of the OS out for original Amigas, another new one for Power PCs (whatever they are), Vampire have one (AROS I think?). And there&amp;rsquo;s an A500 mini coming out, that&amp;rsquo;s just for games but it&amp;rsquo;s still cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a blog that takes people from where I was a few months ago (vaguely remember the Amiga from 25 years ago) to being able to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on now. And in the process I hope I will get some new knowledge, which I will also blog here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly I would like to use this blog to catalogue some unfinished business I have from 25 years go. I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS (Amiga BASIC). It kind of worked, but when the aliens got the to edge of the screen they all just wandered off in different directions. It was such a weird bug, and I did persevere with it for a bit, but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out and I gave up. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write that Space Invaders game, in AMOS, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to work, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to make me a better data scientist. And then, who knows, I may keep going with more games. See how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me next time when I describe all the different ways of getting your Amiga on in rough outline, and then I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll follow up with more details of each (I only use FS-UAE and a RPi at the moment, but a Vampire is on my shopping list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to learn some AMOS.&lt;/p&gt;
