<p>I&rsquo;m off work recovering from surgery at the moment and during that time my interest in retro games has deepened quite a bit. I&rsquo;ve spent a long time with the <a href="https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/a500mini/">Amiga mini and cataloguing old classic games on there</a> and I&rsquo;ve also spent time setting up <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">Retro arch</a> on my Linux box and <a href="https://www.emudeck.com/">Emudeck</a> on my Steam Deck.</p>
<p>At first I was interested because of the history of games. It&rsquo;s really interesting to see how they&rsquo;ve developed over time, and I always find it fascinating when new genres emerge that were possible on old hardware but just nobody thought of it. You couldn&rsquo;t make a bombastic game like Call of Duty on a 48K Spectrum, but you could have made a survival game, in the vein of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Starve">Don&rsquo;t Starve</a>. Nobody thought of it. Or maybe they did, and I haven&rsquo;t heard of it, and the genre lay dormant through the 16 + 32 bit years only to reemerge later, which is kind of interesting in itself. I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Video_Games_You_Must_Play_Before_You_Die">1001 videogames to play before you die</a> which I love because it&rsquo;s in chronological order, and it&rsquo;s just really interesting to see the artform evolve over time. Ditto the excellent <a href="https://www.bitmapbooks.com/products/commodore-amiga-a-visual-commpendium">Amiga</a> and <a href="https://www.bitmapbooks.com/products/commodore-amiga-a-visual-commpendium">SNES</a> Bitmap books, which are absolutely beautiful, also in chronological order, and you can see how things changed even within one platform.</p>
<p>Over time I realised that part of the fun is making everything work. I remember when I was a kid with my Amiga you&rsquo;d fiddle around with the software until it broke, and then have fun putting it back to how it was before you broke it. It&rsquo;s sort of the same satisfaction I get with my job (data scientist), either taking something that doesn&rsquo;t work and making it work, or even, yes sometimes I do break something (like the server) and have to put it right. There is so much to know about emulators, and BIOS&rsquo;s, and scraping game information and I&rsquo;m just sort of immersed in it along with the games themselves- the best Neo Geo games, the evolution of the shooter, the different graphical styles of (say) the Megadrive and SNES.</p>
<p>And at the end of it I like to write it all down. I&rsquo;d be amazed if more than five people ever read the words I&rsquo;m typing right now, but I&rsquo;m really not writing to be read. I don&rsquo;t ever feel like I&rsquo;ve understood something properly until I&rsquo;ve written it down, I&rsquo;m the same at work- I like to catalogue and codify everything and then just stick it on the internet in case it helps someone else.</p>
<p>So I may pivot this blog to &ldquo;Amigas and retro games&rdquo;, perhaps, I hardly want separate blogs about each, and spend some time talking about the history and evolution of games as well as how to play them with modern hardware (one day I shall treat myself to a <a href="https://polymega.com/">Polymega</a>, no doubt, but that day has not come yet). In any case, this post serves as a very long winded introduction to a post I&rsquo;ve already decided to produce, all about the <a href="https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/c64-special/">C64 mini</a></p>
