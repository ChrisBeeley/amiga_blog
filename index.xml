      <description>In the introduction of this blog there is a list of some of the different ways that you can get hold of an Amiga in modern times and this is the thing that by far confused me the most when I started back after 25 years away.

      <content>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/intro/&#34;&gt;introduction of this blog&lt;/a&gt; there is a list of some of the different ways that you can get hold of an Amiga in modern times and this is the thing that by far confused me the most when I started back after 25 years away. There are a lot of different ways of getting your Amiga fix and this post is designed to help you to understand what the heck they are. Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the list from the introduction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FS-UAE (emulation- Windows, Mac, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry pi (several options here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A5000 (new hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vampire (new FPGA powered hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MiSTer FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list breaks down essentially into the following types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New hardware based on PowerPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what half that stuff is, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you, as well as providing some links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;original-hardware&#34;&gt;Original hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest, sort of. There&amp;rsquo;s a surprising amount of original Amiga hardware that is still alive and kicking. Very often things will be sold recapped, which means that the capacitors have been replaced. Often they will have had a good clean and test too. Recapping is pretty important because old capacitors can leak and damage the hardware. Other times you see listings that say &amp;ldquo;I just got this out of my loft, I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea if it works, you can buy it and find out if you want&amp;rdquo;. This is fine but clearly you are going to want to spend a lot less on such a purchase because you really don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some companies that sell old Amiga hardware. I feel sure I will buy an A1200 as soon as I find space for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ami64.com/amiga-computers&#34;&gt;Ami64.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.retropassion.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Retro Passion&lt;/a&gt;. The thing I love about this shop is that they will even sell you a replica box! There were some very fancy Amiga boxes back in the day but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had one, both my A500 and A1200 came in plain white boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are loads of upgrades you can get now for original hardware, such as CF based solid state hard drives, loads of accelerators, USB flash drives. Plugging an Amiga in to a modern TV can be a bit of a challenge, I don&amp;rsquo;t understand this well enough to help you but I gather it&amp;rsquo;s possible with the right adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emulation&#34;&gt;Emulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the simplest, sort of. There are two main types of emulation, really, normal PC and raspberry pi, so let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at both&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;normal-pc&#34;&gt;Normal PC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Windows, I would just pick up a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amigaforever.com/&#34;&gt;Amiga Forever&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with emulation, Workbench, ROM files, everything you need really. It&amp;rsquo;s a little easier as far as I can tell, on Windows. For Linux and Mac you may end up buying Amiga Forever anyway, I did, because it comes as I mentioned with Workbench and ROM files. These files are not open source and so you can steal or buy them, basically. The cheapest way to get them is &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloanto.amigaforever.essentials&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;gl=US&#34;&gt;on Android&lt;/a&gt; but I use Linux and I bought Amiga Forever anyway because it comes with some free games and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of free games and stuff, there is absolutely masses of software &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.org/details/Commodore_Amiga_TOSEC_2012_04_10&#34;&gt;for download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Raspberry pi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few options here, if you just want to play games you can use something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://blitterstudio.com/amiberry/&#34;&gt;Amiberry&lt;/a&gt; which you can download in things like &lt;a href=&#34;https://retropie.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Retro Pie&lt;/a&gt; or is available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://gunkrist79.wixsite.com/amibian&#34;&gt;Amibian&lt;/a&gt;. Another nice option is &lt;a href=&#34;https://retrogamecoders.com/pimiga/&#34;&gt;PiMiga&lt;/a&gt;, which gives a souped up desktop, applications, and games straight out of the gate. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome. At the moment there is a 1.5 version, I gather 2.0 is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option for Raspberry pi is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amikit.amiga.sk/raspberry&#34;&gt;AmiKit&lt;/a&gt;, I fiddled around with the free Linux version and didn&amp;rsquo;t love it, but you might, have a look, don&amp;rsquo;t take my word for it. There&amp;rsquo;s a free and a paid version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New hardware based on PowerPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>If you read my introduction then you&amp;rsquo;ll know that part of the reason I&amp;rsquo;m doing this blog, doing any of this in fact, is because I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS 25 years ago, got a weird bug, and gave up. More for my reference than anything else (like 95% of my GitHub, in fact), here follows a list of the options I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at so far</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;If you read &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisbeeley.github.io/amiga_blog/posts/intro/&#34;&gt;my introduction&lt;/a&gt; then you&amp;rsquo;ll know that part of the reason I&amp;rsquo;m doing this blog, doing any of this in fact, is because I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS 25 years ago, got a weird bug, and gave up. More for my reference than anything else (like 95% of my GitHub, in fact), here follows a list of the options I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at so far&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMOS (which comes in Easy and Professional form)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlitzBasic (which got to version 2 but now seems to have been upgraded to the related 3, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amiblitz.de/index.php&#34;&gt;which looks pretty swish&lt;/a&gt; with an IDE and everything)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C (I would love to learn C but I gather it&amp;rsquo;s pretty hard)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assembler (I&amp;rsquo;ve read Assembler and it looks like what most people think normal programming languages look like- gobbledigook)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much going to work down the list, I think, I&amp;rsquo;m going to go give BlitzBasic 3 a try, probably will bounce off that and then try C. But who knows? This is pretty fun, could end up anywhere. I highly doubt I will write a line of Amiga Assembler in my life but never say never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I should add is that I really want to write the code on an Amiga. An emulated one at the moment, and then perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll treat myself to a Vampire some time. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much room in the office but Vampires are pretty small. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write games &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the Amiga, I want to write them &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the Amiga. You know, for old time&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next post is I think one aimed at my buddies, entitled, &amp;ldquo;So you want to play Amiga games without buying any new hardware?&amp;rdquo; (super easy and cheap).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Chris Beeley and I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist. You can find my GitHub here and my team&amp;rsquo;s GitHub here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve returned to the Amiga after a long absence and will be explaining the modern Amiga scene (to the best of my ability) and chronicling my quest to write Space Invaders in AMOS (Amiga BASIC, essentially).
Come say hi on Twitter if you like, if you like Amigas I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ll get on great, or even if you don&amp;rsquo;t come say hi anyway.</description>

      <description>Hello! This blog is all about my return to the world of Amiga. I have been clicking occasionally on Amiga stuff that I saw in my Twitter feed and was amazed to see that an Amiga print magazine was being launched in the UK. I was an avid user of the Amiga from about 1988 until about 1995. It was a really important part of my life and the hours of messing around I used to do with Workbench to get everything working are probably partly the reason why I do the job that I do (data scientist, which I absolutely love).</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello! This blog is all about my return to the world of Amiga. I have been clicking occasionally on Amiga stuff that I saw in my Twitter feed and was amazed to see that an Amiga print magazine was being launched in the UK. I was an avid user of the Amiga from about 1988 until about 1995. It was a really important part of my life and the hours of messing around I used to do with Workbench to get everything working are probably partly the reason why I do the job that I do (data scientist, which I absolutely love). I might do a nostalgic trip through what growing up with Amiga (500, then 1200 with 60MB hard drive) was like but that isn&amp;rsquo;t for today, this is just kicking things off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog for a few reasons. Firstly, because I cannot believe how strong the Amiga community is today. The Amiga lives on, 25 years later, and there are so many awesome helpful people in it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t met any of them or even written a message on a board but I can tell that they are my people. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve come home after a long absence. I want to be a part of that community and hopefully give something back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, because the Amiga scene, even though it is full of awesome people sharing their knowledge, is pretty confusing. Some people are using old hardware, and I would absolutely love to get some original hardware, but there are a lot of options now. I haven&amp;rsquo;t done all the research yet (but I will, for this blog) but broadly the options are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FS-UAE (emulation- Windows, Mac, Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry pi (several options here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A5000 (new hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vampire (new FPGA powered hardware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MiSTer FPGA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new version of the OS out for original Amigas, another new one for Power PCs (whatever they are), Vampire have one (AROS I think?). And there&amp;rsquo;s an A500 mini coming out, that&amp;rsquo;s just for games but it&amp;rsquo;s still cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a blog that takes people from where I was a few months ago (vaguely remember the Amiga from 25 years ago) to being able to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on now. And in the process I hope I will get some new knowledge, which I will also blog here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly I would like to use this blog to catalogue some unfinished business I have from 25 years go. I tried to write Space Invaders in AMOS (Amiga BASIC). It kind of worked, but when the aliens got the to edge of the screen they all just wandered off in different directions. It was such a weird bug, and I did persevere with it for a bit, but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out and I gave up. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write that Space Invaders game, in AMOS, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to work, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to make me a better data scientist. And then, who knows, I may keep going with more games. See how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me next time when I describe all the different ways of getting your Amiga on in rough outline, and then I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll follow up with more details of each (I only use FS-UAE and a RPi at the moment, but a Vampire is on my shopping list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to learn some AMOS.&lt;/p&gt;
