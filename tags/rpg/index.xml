      <description>I love tactical RPGs. I remember once taking Final Fantasy: The War of the Lions on PSP on holiday with my poor wife one year. She got very annoyed because every time I stopped moving for any reason I would whip out my PSP (which was in sleep mode, not off) and start playing. It was quite annoying. I regret doing that now.
Anyway, I haven&amp;rsquo;t played them in any kind of systematic way but I have played FF: TWOL, Disgaea 5, Valkyria Chronicles, Metal Gear Acid, Freedom Force, Shadowrun, amongst others.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I love tactical RPGs. I remember once taking Final Fantasy: The War of the Lions on PSP on holiday with my poor wife one year. She got very annoyed because every time I stopped moving for any reason I would whip out my PSP (which was in sleep mode, not off) and start playing. It was quite annoying. I regret doing that now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I haven&amp;rsquo;t played them in any kind of systematic way but I have played FF: TWOL, Disgaea 5, Valkyria Chronicles, Metal Gear Acid, Freedom Force, Shadowrun, amongst others. Does XCom count? I guess it probably does. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; XCom. I have 70 hours logged in XCom and 129 on XCom 2 on Steam, I would think another 50+ on XCom2 on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with everything, the genre is absolutely replete with stuff I have never heard of or played (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type_Tactics&#34;&gt;R Type tactics&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_d%27Arc_(video_game)&#34;&gt;Jeanne D&amp;rsquo;Arc&lt;/a&gt;?) so this post is my attempt to get it all straight in my head. I will play a few and write it all up here. It will be fun to replay FFT: TWOL, I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember it but I obviously enjoyed it since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop playing it on holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-tactical-rpg&#34;&gt;What is a tactical RPG?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up calling them strategy RPGs, SRPGs for short, but it would appear that all the cool kids are now calling them tactical RPGs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WIP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langrisser&#34;&gt;Langrisser&lt;/a&gt; was an early release on the Megadrive. It has seen been &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1060220/Langrisser_I__II/&#34;&gt;remade on Steam&lt;/a&gt;. There were sequels on SNES, PS2, Windows, and Saturn.&lt;/p&gt;
